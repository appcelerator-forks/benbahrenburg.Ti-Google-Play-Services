<h2>Google Play Services for Titanium</h2>

The goal of this repo is to help catalog and provide tooling support for the versions of Google Play Servies used by different modules in Titanium.

<h2>By Module</h2>

<h3>Ti.Map</h3>
You can find the versions of Google Play packaged with the Ti.Map module organized by version at  [https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Modules/Ti.Map](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Modules/Ti.Map)

<h3>Ti.GA</h3>
You can find the versions of Google Play packaged with the Ti.GA module organized by version at  [https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Modules/Ti.GA](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Modules/Ti.GA)

<h2>By Ti SDK Version</h2>
Hopefully Titanium will package only one version of Google Play Services by version.
Starting with Ti SDK 5.1.0.GA you can find a list of the complete (full) Google Play Service JAR by Ti SDK version at  [https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Ti-SDK](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Ti-SDK)
